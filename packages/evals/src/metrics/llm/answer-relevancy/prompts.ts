Key Principles:
1. Evaluate whether the output addresses what the input is asking for
2. Consider both direct answers and related context
3. Prioritize relevance to the input over correctness
4. Recognize that responses can be partially relevant
5. Empty inputs or error messages should always be marked as "no"
6. Responses that discuss the type of information being asked show partial relevance`;

Don't split too aggressively.

Split compound statements particularly when they:
- Are joined by "and"
- Contain multiple distinct facts or claims
- Have multiple descriptive elements about the subject


Handle special cases:
- A single word answer should be treated as a complete statement
- Error messages should be treated as a single statement
- Empty strings should return an empty list
- When splitting text, keep related information together

Example:
Example text: Look! A bird! Birds are an interesting animal.

{{
    "statements": ["Look!", "A bird!", "Birds are interesting animals."]
}}

Please return only JSON format with "statements" array.
Return empty list for empty input.

    Return JSON with array of verdict objects. Each verdict must include:
    - "verdict": "yes", "no", or "unsure"
    - "reason": Clear explanation of the verdict

    Verdict Guidelines:
    - "yes": Statement explicitly and directly answers the input question when it:
        * Contains specific answer to the question asked (e.g., "The color of the sky is blue")
        * States explicit relationship between key concepts (e.g., "X is the CEO of company Y")
        * Can stand alone as a complete answer
        * Contains appropriate question-type response (e.g., location for "where", person for "who")
        * Note: If statement is incorrect but directly addresses the question, mark as "unsure"

    - "unsure": Statement shows partial relevance when it:
        * Discusses the type of information being asked about (e.g., mentions temperatures when asked about temperature)
        * Contains information about the answer without explicit statement
        * Uses importance indicators ("main", "primary", "major") with relevant concepts
        * Includes indirect references to the answer (e.g., "where the president works")
        * Contains topic-related administrative/governance terms without direct answer
        * References functions or characteristics typically associated with the answer
        * Uses terms that match what's being asked about
        * Mentions related entities without specifying their relationship to the answer
        * Is incorrect but shows understanding of the question
        * Contains the answer term but needs more context to be complete
        * Contains measurement units or quantities relevant to the question type
        * References locations or entities in the same category as what's being asked about
        * Provides relevant information without using explicit question-type terminology
        * Contains references to properties of the subject that relate to the question type


    - "no": Statement lacks meaningful connection to question when it:
        * Contains neither the subject nor the type of information being requested
        * Contains no terms related to what's being asked about
        * Contains only general subject information without relating to what's being asked
        * Consists of empty or meaningless content
        * Contains purely tangential information with no mention of the subject or question type
        * Discusses the subject but not the specific attribute being asked about
        * Note: Assessment is about connection to what's being asked, not factual accuracy
        * Contains no connection to what's being asked about (neither the subject nor the type of information requested)

    REMEMBER: 
    - If the statement contains words or phrases that are relevant to the input, it is partially relevant.
    - If the statement is a direct answer to the input, it is relevant.
    - If the statement is completely unrelated to the input or contains nothing, it is not relevant.
    - DO NOT MAKE A JUDGEMENT ON THE CORRECTNESS OF THE STATEMENT, JUST THE RELEVANCY.

    STRICT RULES:
    - If a statement mentions the type of information being requested, it should be marked as "unsure" ONLY if it's discussing that type meaningfully (not just mentioning it)
    - Subject mentions alone are NOT enough for relevance - they must connect to what's being asked about
    - Empty or meaningless statements are always "no"
    - General facts about the subject without connection to the question type should be marked as "no"
    - ALWAYS mark a statement as "no" if it discusses the topic without any connection to the question type
    - Statements that mention neither the subject nor the type of information are always "no"
    - Type-level relevance overrides topic-only content
    - Measurement/quantity relevance counts as type-level relevance
    - Administrative/governance terms are only relevant if they relate to the question type
    - Descriptive facts about the subject should be marked as "no" unless they directly relate to the question type


    Examples of "no" statements:
        * "Japan has beautiful seasons" for "What is Japan's largest city?"
        * "Trees grow tall" for "How tall is Mount Everest?"
        * "The weather is nice" for "Who is the president?"
