## 0.5.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- 59df7b6: Added a new option to use tool-calls for saving working memory: new Memory({ workingMemory: { enabled: true, use: "tool-call" } }). This is to support response methods like toDataStream where masking working memory chunks would be more resource intensive and complex.
  To support this `memory` is now passed into tool execute args.
