# Adding Tools

Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows, with built-in integration access and parameter validation. Each tool has a schema that defines its inputs, an executor function that implements its logic, and access to configured integrations.

## Creating Tools

In this section, we'll walk through the process of creating a tool that can be used by your agents. Let's create a simple tool that fetches current weather information for a given city.

### **Example Tool: Weather Information**

First, let's define a tool that retrieves weather data using a public API.

#### Adding a Weather Tool

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/weatherInfo.ts"
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const getWeatherInfo = async (city: string) => {
  // Replace with an actual API call to a weather service
  const data = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/weather?city=${city}`).then((r) =>
    r.json(),
  );
  return data;
};

export const weatherInfo = createTool({
  label: "Get Weather Information",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
  execute: async ({ context: { city } }) => {
    console.log("Using tool to fetch weather information for", city);
    return await getWeatherInfo(city);
  },
});
```

In this code:

- **`label`**: A human-readable name for the tool.
- **`inputSchema`**: A Zod schema defining the expected input parameters.
- **`description`**: A description of what the tool does.
- **`execute`**: An asynchronous function that performs the tool's main logic.

## Adding Tools to an Agent

Now we'll add the tool to an agent. We'll create an agent that can answer questions about the weather and configure it to use our `weatherInfo` tool.

#### Adding the Weather Tool to an Agent

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/weatherAgent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core";
import { weatherInfo } from "../tools";

export const weatherAgent = new Agent<typeof tools>({
  name: "Weather Agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that provides current weather information. When asked about the weather, use the weather information tool to fetch the data.",
  model: {
    provider: "OPEN_AI",
    name: "gpt-4",
    toolChoice: "required",
  },
  tools: {
    weatherInfo,
  }
});
```

In this agent configuration:

- **`name`**: A unique name for the agent.
- **`instructions`**: Guidance provided to the agent to define its behavior.
- **`model`**: Specifies the AI model to use.
- **`tools`**: Specifies which tools the agent has access to.

## Setting Up Mastra

We need to initialize Mastra with our agent.

#### Registering the Agent

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents/weatherAgent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent },
});
```

This registers your agent with Mastra, making it available for use.

## Debugging Tools

You can test tools using Jest or any other testing framework. Writing unit tests for your tools ensures they behave as expected and helps catch errors early.

## Calling an Agent with a Tool

Now we can call the agent, and it will use the tool to fetch the weather information.

#### Example: Interacting with the Agent

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { mastra } from "./index";

async function main() {
  const agent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");
  const response = await agent.generate({
    messages: ["What's the weather like in New York City today?"],
  });

  console.log(response.text);
}

main();
```

The agent will use the `weatherInfo` tool to get the current weather in New York City and respond accordingly.

## Tool Configuration

A tool requires:

- **`label`**: Name of the tool (e.g., "Get Weather Information").
- **`inputSchema`**: Zod schema for validating inputs like city names.
- **`description`**: Clear explanation of what the tool does.
- **`execute`**: Async function that performs the tool's logic.

The executor receives:

- **`data`**: Contains the validated input parameters for your tool.
- **`runId`**: Unique identifier for the current execution (optional).
- **`agents`**: Access to all registered agents in the system.
- **`engine`**: Reference to the Mastra engine instance (optional).
- **`llm`**: Access to the Language Model instance.
