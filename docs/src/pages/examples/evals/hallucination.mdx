# Hallucination

This example demonstrates how to use Mastra's Hallucination metric to evaluate whether responses contradict information provided in the context.

## Overview

The example shows how to:

1. Configure the Hallucination metric
2. Evaluate factual contradictions
3. Analyze hallucination scores
4. Handle different accuracy levels

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Dependencies

Import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/index.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { HallucinationMetric } from '@mastra/evals/llm';
```

## Example Usage

### No Hallucination Example

Evaluate a response that matches context exactly:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{5} filename="src/index.ts"
const context1 = [
  'The iPhone was first released in 2007.',
  'Steve Jobs unveiled it at Macworld.',
  'The original model had a 3.5-inch screen.',
];

const metric1 = new HallucinationMetric(openai('gpt-4o-mini'), {
  context: context1,
});

const query1 = 'When was the first iPhone released?';
const response1 = 'The iPhone was first released in 2007, when Steve Jobs unveiled it at Macworld. The original iPhone featured a 3.5-inch screen.';

console.log('\nExample 1 - No Hallucination:');
console.log('Context:', context1);
console.log('Query:', query1);
console.log('Response:', response1);

const result1 = await metric1.measure(query1, response1);
console.log('Metric Result:', {
  score: result1.score,
  reason: result1.info.reason,
});
```

### Mixed Hallucination Example

Evaluate a response that contradicts some facts:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{31} filename="src/index.ts"
const context2 = [
  'The first Star Wars movie was released in 1977.',
  'It was directed by George Lucas.',
  'The film earned $775 million worldwide.',
  'The movie was filmed in Tunisia and England.',
];

const metric2 = new HallucinationMetric(openai('gpt-4o-mini'), {
  context: context2,
});

const query2 = 'Tell me about the first Star Wars movie.';
const response2 = 'The first Star Wars movie came out in 1977 and was directed by George Lucas. It made over $1 billion at the box office and was filmed entirely in California.';

console.log('\nExample 2 - Mixed Hallucination:');
console.log('Context:', context2);
console.log('Query:', query2);
console.log('Response:', response2);

const result2 = await metric2.measure(query2, response2);
console.log('Metric Result:', {
  score: result2.score,
  reason: result2.info.reason,
});
```

### Complete Hallucination Example

Evaluate a response that contradicts all facts:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{58} filename="src/index.ts"
const context3 = [
  'The Wright brothers made their first flight in 1903.',
  'The flight lasted 12 seconds.',
  'It covered a distance of 120 feet.',
];

const metric3 = new HallucinationMetric(openai('gpt-4o-mini'), {
  context: context3,
});

const query3 = 'When did the Wright brothers first fly?';
const response3 = 'The Wright brothers achieved their historic first flight in 1908. The flight lasted about 2 minutes and covered nearly a mile.';

console.log('\nExample 3 - Complete Hallucination:');
console.log('Context:', context3);
console.log('Query:', query3);
console.log('Response:', response3);

const result3 = await metric3.measure(query3, response3);
console.log('Metric Result:', {
  score: result3.score,
  reason: result3.info.reason,
});
```

## Understanding the Results

The metric provides:

1. A hallucination score between 0 and 1:
   - 0.0: No hallucination - no contradictions with context
   - 0.3-0.4: Low hallucination - few contradictions
   - 0.5-0.6: Mixed hallucination - some contradictions
   - 0.7-0.8: High hallucination - many contradictions
   - 0.9-1.0: Complete hallucination - contradicts all context

2. Detailed analysis of:
   - Statement verification
   - Contradictions found
   - Factual accuracy
   - Overall hallucination level
