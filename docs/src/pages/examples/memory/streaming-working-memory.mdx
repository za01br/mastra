# Streaming Working Memory

This example demonstrates how to create an agent that maintains a working memory for relevant conversational details like the users name, location, or preferences.

## Setup

First, set up the memory system with working memory enabled. Memory uses LibSQL storage by default, but you can use any other [storage provider](/docs/agents/01-agent-memory#storage-options) if needed:

### Text Stream Mode (Default)

```typescript
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";

const memory = new Memory({
  options: {
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
      use: 'text-stream', // this is the default mode
    },
  },
});
```

### Tool Call Mode

Alternatively, you can use tool calls for working memory updates. This mode is required when using `toDataStream()` as text-stream mode is not compatible with data streaming:

```typescript
const toolCallMemory = new Memory({
  options: {
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
      use: 'tool-call', // Required for toDataStream() compatibility
    },
  },
});
```

Add the memory instance to an agent:

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Memory agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  memory, // or toolCallMemory
});
```

## Usage Example

Now that working memory is set up you can interact with the agent and it will remember key details about interactions.

### Text Stream Mode

In text stream mode, the agent includes working memory updates directly in its responses:

```typescript
import { randomUUID } from "crypto";
import { maskStreamTags } from "@mastra/core/utils";

const threadId = randomUUID();
const resourceId = "SOME_USER_ID";

const response = await agent.stream("Hello, my name is Jane", {
  threadId,
  resourceId,
});

// Process response stream, hiding working memory tags
for await (const chunk of maskStreamTags(response.textStream, "working_memory")) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

### Tool Call Mode

In tool call mode, the agent uses a dedicated tool to update working memory:

```typescript
const toolCallResponse = await toolCallAgent.stream("Hello, my name is Jane", {
  threadId,
  resourceId,
});

// No need to mask working memory tags since updates happen through tool calls
for await (const chunk of toolCallResponse.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

### Handling response data

In text stream mode, the response stream will contain xml-like `<working_memory>$data</working_memory>` tagged data.
Mastra picks up these tags and automatically updates working memory with the data returned by the LLM.

To prevent showing this data to users you can use the `maskStreamTags` util as shown above.

In tool call mode, working memory updates happen through tool calls, so there's no need to mask any tags.

## Summary

This example demonstrates:

1. Setting up memory with working memory enabled in either text-stream or tool-call mode
2. Using `maskStreamTags` to hide memory updates in text-stream mode
3. The agent maintaining relevant user info between interactions in both modes
4. Different approaches to handling working memory updates

## Advanced use cases

For examples on controlling which information is relevant for working memory, or showing loading states while working memory is being saved, see our [advanced working memory example](/examples/memory/streaming-working-memory-advanced).
