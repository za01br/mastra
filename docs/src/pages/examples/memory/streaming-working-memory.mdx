# Streaming Working Memory

This example demonstrates how to create an agent that maintains a working memory for relevant conversational details like the users name, location, or preferences.

## Setup

First, set up the memory system with working memory enabled. Memory uses LibSQL storage by default, but you can use any other [storage provider](/docs/agents/01-agent-memory#storage-options) if needed:

```typescript
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";

const memory = new Memory({
  options: {
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  },
});
```

Add the memory instance to an agent

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const todoAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Memory agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  memory,
});
```

## Usage Example

Now that working memory is set up you can interact with the agent and it will remember key details about interactions.

First start a conversation and give the agent relevant information like your name.

```typescript
import { randomUUID } from "crypto";

const threadId = randomUUID();
const resourceId = "SOME_USER_ID";

const response = await todoAgent.stream("Hello, my name is Jane", {
  threadId,
  resourceId,
});

// process response stream
for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

### Handling response data

The response stream will contain xml-like `<working_memory>$data</working_memory>` tagged data.
Mastra picks up these tags and automatically updates working memory with the data returned by the LLM.

To prevent showing this data to users you can import the `maskStreamTags` util and pass the stream response through it.

```typescript
import { maskStreamTags } from "@mastra/core/utils";

for await (const chunk of maskStreamTags(
  response.textStream, // pass the text stream
  "working_memory", // and the name of the working memory tag
)) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

## Summary

This example demonstrates:

1. Setting up a memory system with working memory enabled
2. Using `maskStreamTags` to hide memory updates from users
3. The agent will maintain relevant user info between interactions, even when the original messages containing that info are no longer in context.

## Advanced use cases

For examples on controlling which information is relevant for working memory, or showing loading states while working memory is being saved, see our [advanced working memory example](/examples/memory/streaming-working-memory-advanced).
