# Logging and Tracing

Effective logging and tracing are crucial for understanding the behavior of your application.

Tracing is especially important for AI engineering. Teams building AI products find that visibility into inputs and outputs of every step of every run is crucial to improving accuracy. You get this with Mastra's telemetry.

## Logging

In Mastra, logs can detail when certain functions run, what input data they receive, and how they respond.

### Basic Setup

Here's a minimal example that sets up a **console logger** at the `INFO` level. This will print out informational messages and above (i.e., `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) to the console.

```typescript filename="mastra.config.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra, createLogger } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // Other Mastra configuration...
  logger: createLogger({
    type: "CONSOLE",
    level: "INFO",
  }),
});
```

In this configuration:

- `type: "CONSOLE"` specifies that logs should be output to the console.
- `level: "INFO"` sets the minimum severity of logs to record.

### Configuration

- For more details on the options you can pass to `createLogger()`, see the [createLogger reference documentation](/docs/reference/observability/create-logger.mdx).
- Once you have a `Logger` instance, you can call its methods (e.g., `.info()`, `.warn()`, `.error()`) in the [Logger instance reference documentation](/docs/reference/observability/logger.mdx).
- If you need to direct logs to multiple destinations—like both console and an external logging service—see the [combineLoggers reference documentation](/docs/reference/observability/combine-loggers.mdx).
- If you want to send your logs to an external service for centralized collection, analysis, or storage, you can configure other logger types such as Upstash Redis. Consult the [createLogger reference documentation](/docs/reference/observability/create-logger.mdx) for details on parameters like `url`, `token`, and `key` when using the `UPSTASH` logger type.

## Telemetry

Mastra supports the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for tracing and monitoring your application. When telemetry is enabled, Mastra automatically traces all core primitives including agent operations, LLM interactions, tool executions, integration calls, workflow runs, and database operations. Your telemetry data can then be exported to any OTEL collector.

### Basic Configuration

Here's a simple example of enabling telemetry:

```ts filename="mastra.config.ts" showLineNumbers copy
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "my-app",
    enabled: true,
    sampling: {
      type: "always_on",
    },
    export: {
      type: "otlp",
      endpoint: "http://localhost:4318", // SigNoz local endpoint
    },
  },
});
```

### Configuration Options

The telemetry config accepts these properties:

```ts
type OtelConfig = {
  // Name to identify your service in traces (optional)
  serviceName?: string;

  // Enable/disable telemetry (defaults to true)
  enabled?: boolean;

  // Control how many traces are sampled
  sampling?: {
    type: "ratio" | "always_on" | "always_off" | "parent_based";
    probability?: number; // For ratio sampling
    root?: {
      probability: number; // For parent_based sampling
    };
  };

  // Where to send telemetry data
  export?: {
    type: "otlp" | "console";
    endpoint?: string;
    headers?: Record<string, string>;
  };
};
```

See the [OtelConfig reference documentation](/docs/reference/observability/otel-config.mdx) for more details.

### Environment Variables

You can configure the OTLP endpoint and headers through environment variables:

```env filename=".env" copy
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-api-key=your-api-key
```

Then in your config:

```ts filename="mastra.config.ts" showLineNumbers copy
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "my-app",
    enabled: true,
    export: {
      type: "otlp",
      // endpoint and headers will be picked up from env vars
    },
  },
});
```

### Example: SigNoz Integration

Here's what a traced agent interaction looks like in [SigNoz](https://signoz.io):

<img
  src="/signoz-telemetry-demo.png"
  alt="Agent interaction trace showing spans, LLM calls, and tool executions"
  style={{ maxWidth: "800px", width: "100%", margin: "8px 0" }}
  className="nextra-image rounded-md"
  data-zoom
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

### Other Supported Providers

For a complete list of supported observability providers and their configuration details, see the [Observability Providers reference](../reference/observability/providers/).

### Next.js Configuration [Local Dev]

When developing locally with Next.js, you'll need to:

1. Install the instrumentation package:

```bash copy
npm install import-in-the-middle # or require-in-the-middle for CJS
```

2. Add it as an external dependency in your Next.js config:

```ts filename="next.config.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ["import-in-the-middle"],
};

export default nextConfig;
```

This configuration is only necessary for local development to ensure proper instrumentation during hot reloading.
