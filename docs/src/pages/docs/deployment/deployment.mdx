# Deploying Mastra to the Cloud

In this guide, we'll cover how to deploy your Mastra agents and workflows using the `mastra deploy` command. Once deployed, your agents and workflows will be available via REST endpoints.

Currently, the Mastra CLI supports deploying to **Vercel** and **Cloudflare Workers**.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** installed (version 18 or higher is recommended).
- **Mastra CLI** installed globally:

```bash copy
npm install -g mastra
```

- An existing Mastra project set up. If not, initialize one using:

```bash copy
mastra init
```

- A Vercel account (if deploying to Vercel) or a Cloudflare account (if deploying to Cloudflare Workers).

## Deploying to Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. Mastra can be easily deployed to Vercel using the CLI. 

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Install the Vercel CLI** (if you haven't already):

```bash copy
npm install -g vercel
```

2. **Login to Vercel**:

```bash copy
vercel login
```

3. **Deploy with Mastra CLI**:

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash copy
mastra deploy vercel
```

The CLI will guide you through the deployment process, including:

- **Authentication**: If you haven't provided a Vercel token before, you'll be prompted to enter one.
- **Team Selection**: Choose the Vercel team or scope to deploy under.
- **Environment Variables**: Set any required environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

4. **Set Environment Variables on Vercel** (Optional):

If you didn't set environment variables during deployment, you can configure them in the Vercel dashboard:

- Go to your Vercel project.
- Navigate to **Settings > Environment Variables**.
- Add your variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

### Example

```bash copy
cd your-mastra-project
mastra deploy vercel
```

Follow the prompts provided by the CLI to complete the deployment.

## Deploying to Cloudflare Workers

[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) allow you to deploy serverless applications to Cloudflare's edge network.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Install the Wrangler CLI**:

```bash copy
npm install -g wrangler
```

2. **Login to Cloudflare**:

```bash copy
wrangler login
```

3. **Deploy with Mastra CLI**:

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash copy
mastra deploy cloudflare
```

The CLI will guide you through the process, including:

- **Authentication**: If you haven't logged in, you'll be prompted to do so.
- **Project Configuration**: The CLI will generate a `wrangler.toml` file with necessary settings.
- **Environment Variables**: Set any required variables in the `wrangler.toml` file or via the Cloudflare dashboard.

4. **Set Environment Variables in `wrangler.toml`**:

Edit the `wrangler.toml` file in your project directory to include your environment variables:

```toml
[vars]
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your-anthropic-api-key"
```

### Example

```bash copy
cd your-mastra-project
mastra deploy cloudflare
```

Follow the prompts provided by the CLI to complete the deployment.

## Additional Tips

### Ensure Your `mastra` Instance is Exported Properly

Make sure that your `mastra` instance is exported in your entry file (e.g., `src/mastra/index.ts`):

```typescript:src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // Your configuration here
});
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your Mastra agents and workflows. They're live on the internet and ready to be used by your users.
