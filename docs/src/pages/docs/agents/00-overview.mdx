# Creating and Calling Agents

Agents in Mastra are systems where the language model can autonomously decide on a sequence of actions to perform tasks. They have access to tools, workflows, and synced data, enabling them to perform complex tasks and interact with external systems. Agents can invoke your custom functions, utilize third-party APIs through integrations, and access knowledge bases you have built.

While the `LLM` class is similar to a contractor you might hire for a one-off task, agents are like employees who can be used for ongoing projects. They have names, persistent memory, consistent model configurations, and instructions across calls, as well as a set of enabled tools.

## 1. Creating an Agent

To create an agent in Mastra, you use the `Agent` class and define its properties:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/index.ts" copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

export const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: "My Agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: {
    provider: "OPEN_AI",
    name: "gpt-4o-mini",
  },
});
```

**Note:** Ensure that you have set the necessary environment variables, such as your OpenAI API key, in your `.env` file:

```.env filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Also, make sure you have the `@mastra/core` package installed:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/core
```

### Registering the Agent

Register your agent with Mastra to enable logging and access to configured tools and integrations:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { myAgent } from "./agents";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

## 2. Generating and streaming text

### Generating text

Use the `.generate()` method to have your agent produce text responses:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
const response = await myAgent.generate([
  { role: "user", content: "Hello, how can you assist me today?" },
]);

console.log("Agent:", response.text);
```

### Streaming responses

For more real-time responses, you can stream the agent's response:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
const stream = await myAgent.stream([
  { role: "user", content: "Tell me a story." },
]);

console.log("Agent:");

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

## **3. Structured Output**

Agents can return structured data by providing a JSON Schema or using a Zod schema.

### Using JSON Schema

```typescript
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    summary: { type: "string" },
    keywords: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
  },
  additionalProperties: false,
  required: ["summary", "keywords"],
};

const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please provide a summary and keywords for the following text: ...",
    },
  ],
  {
    output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

### Using Zod

You can also use Zod schemas for type-safe structured outputs.

First, install Zod:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install zod
```

Then, define a Zod schema and use it with the agent:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { z } from "zod";

// Define the Zod schema
const schema = z.object({
  summary: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

// Use the schema with the agent
const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please provide a summary and keywords for the following text: ...",
    },
  ],
  {
    output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

This allows you to have strong typing and validation for the structured data returned by the agent.

## **4. Running Agents**

Mastra provides a CLI command `mastra dev` to run your agents behind an API. By default, this looks for exported agents in files in the `src/mastra/agents` directory.

### Starting the Server

```bash
mastra dev
```

This will start the server and make your agent available at `http://localhost:4111/api/agents/myAgent/generate`.

### Interacting with the Agent

You can interact with the agent using `curl` from the command line:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/myAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can you assist me today?" }
    ]
  }'
```
