# ToneConsistencyMetric

The `ToneConsistencyMetric` class evaluates the text's emotional tone and sentiment consistency.  It can operate in two modes: comparing tone between input/output pairs or analyzing tone stability within a single text.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { ToneConsistencyMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new ToneConsistencyMetric();

// Compare tone between input and output
const result1 = await metric.measure(
  "I love this amazing product!",
  "This product is wonderful and fantastic!"
);

// Analyze tone stability in a single text
const result2 = await metric.measure(
  "The service is excellent. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is perfect.",
  ""  // Empty string for single-text analysis
);

console.log(result1.score); // Tone consistency score from 0-1
console.log(result2.score); // Tone stability score from 0-1
```

## measure() Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "string",

## Scoring Details

The metric evaluates sentiment consistency through tone pattern analysis and mode-specific scoring.

### Scoring Process

1. Analyzes tone patterns:
   - Extracts sentiment features
   - Computes sentiment scores
   - Measures tone variations

2. Calculates mode-specific score:
   **Tone Consistency** (input and output):
   - Compares sentiment between texts
   - Calculates sentiment difference
   - Score = 1 - (sentiment_difference / max_difference)

   **Tone Stability** (single input):
   - Analyzes sentiment across sentences
   - Calculates sentiment variance
   - Score = 1 - (sentiment_variance / max_variance)

Final score: `mode_specific_score * scale`

### Score interpretation
(0 to scale, default 0-1)
- 1.0: Perfect tone consistency/stability
- 0.7-0.9: Strong consistency with minor variations
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate consistency with noticeable shifts
- 0.1-0.3: Poor consistency with major tone changes
- 0.0: No consistency - completely different tones

## Example with Both Modes

```typescript
import { ToneConsistencyMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new ToneConsistencyMetric();

// Tone Consistency Mode
const consistencyResult = await metric.measure(
  "This product is fantastic and amazing!",
  "The product is excellent and wonderful!"
);
// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.95,
//   info: {
//     responseSentiment: 0.8,
//     referenceSentiment: 0.75,
//     difference: 0.05
//   }
// }

// Tone Stability Mode
const stabilityResult = await metric.measure(
  "Great service! Friendly staff. Perfect atmosphere.",
  ""
);
// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.9,
//   info: {
//     avgSentiment: 0.6,
//     sentimentVariance: 0.1
//   }
// }
```
