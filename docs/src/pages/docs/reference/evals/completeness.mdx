# CompletenessMetric

The `CompletenessMetric` class evaluates how thoroughly an LLM's output covers the key elements present in the input. It analyzes nouns, verbs, topics, and terms to determine coverage and provides a detailed completeness score.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { CompletenessMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new CompletenessMetric();

const result = await metric.measure(
  "Explain how photosynthesis works in plants using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.",
  "Plants use sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose through photosynthesis."
);

console.log(result.score); // Coverage score from 0-1
console.log(result.info); // Object containing detailed metrics about element coverage
```

## measure() Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "string",
      description: "The original text containing key elements to be covered",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "output",
      type: "string",
      description: "The LLM's response to evaluate for completeness",

## Element Extraction Details

The metric extracts and analyzes several types of elements:
- Nouns: Key objects, concepts, and entities
- Verbs: Actions and states (converted to infinitive form)
- Topics: Main subjects and themes
- Terms: Individual significant words

The extraction process includes:
- Normalization of text (removing diacritics, converting to lowercase)
- Splitting camelCase words
- Handling of word boundaries
- Special handling of short words (3 characters or less)
- Deduplication of elements

## Scoring Details

The metric evaluates completeness through linguistic element coverage analysis.

### Scoring Process

1. Extracts key elements:
   - Nouns and named entities
   - Action verbs
   - Topic-specific terms
   - Normalized word forms

2. Calculates coverage of input elements:
   - Exact matches for short terms (≤3 chars)
   - Substantial overlap (>60%) for longer terms

Final score: `(covered_elements / total_input_elements) * scale`

### Score interpretation
(0 to scale, default 0-1)
- 1.0: Complete coverage - contains all input elements
- 0.7-0.9: High coverage - includes most key elements
- 0.4-0.6: Partial coverage - contains some key elements
- 0.1-0.3: Low coverage - missing most key elements
- 0.0: No coverage - output lacks all input elements

## Example with Analysis

```typescript
import { CompletenessMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new CompletenessMetric();

const result = await metric.measure(
  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
  "A brown fox jumped over a dog"
);

// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.75,
//   info: {
//     inputElements: ["quick", "brown", "fox", "jump", "lazy", "dog"],
//     outputElements: ["brown", "fox", "jump", "dog"],
//     missingElements: ["quick", "lazy"],
//     elementCounts: { input: 6, output: 4 }
//   }
// }
```
