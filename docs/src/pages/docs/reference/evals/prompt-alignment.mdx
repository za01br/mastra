# PromptAlignmentMetric

The `PromptAlignmentMetric` class evaluates how strictly an LLM's output follows a set of given prompt instructions. It uses a judge-based system to verify each instruction is followed exactly and provides detailed reasoning for any deviations.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { PromptAlignmentMetric } from "@mastra/evals/llm";

// Configure the model for evaluation
const model = openai("gpt-4o-mini");

const instructions = [
  "Start sentences with capital letters",
  "End each sentence with a period",
  "Use present tense",
];

const metric = new PromptAlignmentMetric(model, {
  instructions,
  scale: 1,
});

const result = await metric.measure(
  "describe the weather",
  "The sun is shining. Clouds float in the sky. A gentle breeze blows.",
);

console.log(result.score); // Alignment score from 0-1
console.log(result.info.reason); // Explanation of the score
```

## Scoring Details

The metric evaluates instruction alignment through:
- Applicability assessment for each instruction
- Strict compliance evaluation for applicable instructions
- Detailed reasoning for all verdicts
- Proportional scoring based on applicable instructions

### Instruction Verdicts

Each instruction receives one of three verdicts:
- "yes": Instruction is applicable and completely followed
- "no": Instruction is applicable but not followed or only partially followed
- "n/a": Instruction is not applicable to the given context

### Scoring Process

1. Evaluates instruction applicability:
   - Determines if each instruction applies to the context
   - Marks irrelevant instructions as "n/a"
   - Considers domain-specific requirements

2. Assesses compliance for applicable instructions:
   - Evaluates each applicable instruction independently
   - Requires complete compliance for "yes" verdict
   - Documents specific reasons for all verdicts

3. Calculates alignment score:
   - Counts followed instructions ("yes" verdicts)
   - Divides by total applicable instructions (excluding "n/a")
   - Scales to configured range

Final score: `(followed_instructions / applicable_instructions) * scale`

### Important Considerations

- Empty outputs:
  - All formatting instructions are considered applicable
  - Marked as "no" since they cannot satisfy requirements
- Domain-specific instructions:
  - Always applicable if about the queried domain
  - Marked as "no" if not followed, not "n/a"
- "n/a" verdicts:
  - Only used for completely different domains
  - Do not affect the final score calculation

### Score interpretation
(0 to scale, default 0-1)
- 1.0: All applicable instructions followed perfectly
- 0.7-0.9: Most applicable instructions followed
- 0.4-0.6: Mixed compliance with applicable instructions
- 0.1-0.3: Limited compliance with applicable instructions
- 0.0: No applicable instructions followed

## Example with Analysis

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { PromptAlignmentMetric } from "@mastra/evals/llm";

// Configure the model for evaluation
const model = openai("gpt-4o-mini");

const metric = new PromptAlignmentMetric(model, {
  instructions: [
    "Use bullet points for each item",
    "Include exactly three examples",
    "End each point with a semicolon"
  ],
  scale: 1
});

const result = await metric.measure(
  "List three fruits",
  "• Apple is red and sweet;
• Banana is yellow and curved;
• Orange is citrus and round."
);

// Example output:
// {
//   score: 1.0,
//   info: {
//     reason: "The score is 1.0 because all instructions were followed exactly:
//           bullet points were used, exactly three examples were provided, and
//           each point ends with a semicolon."
//   }
// }

const result2 = await metric.measure(
  "List three fruits",
  "1. Apple
2. Banana
3. Orange and Grape"
);

// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.33,
//   info: {
//     reason: "The score is 0.33 because: numbered lists were used instead of bullet points,
//           no semicolons were used, and four fruits were listed instead of exactly three."
//   }
// }
```
