# ContextPositionMetric

The `ContextPositionMetric` class evaluates how well context nodes are ordered based on their relevance to the query and output. It uses position-weighted scoring to emphasize the importance of having the most relevant context pieces appear earlier in the sequence.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { ContextPositionMetric } from "@mastra/evals/llm";

// Configure the model for evaluation
const model = openai("gpt-4o-mini");

const metric = new ContextPositionMetric(model, {
  context: [
    "Photosynthesis is a biological process used by plants to create energy from sunlight.",
    "The process of photosynthesis produces oxygen as a byproduct.",
    "Plants need water and nutrients from the soil to grow.",
  ],
});

const result = await metric.measure(
  "What is photosynthesis?",
  "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy.",
);

console.log(result.score); // Position score from 0-1
console.log(result.info.reason); // Explanation of the score
```

## Scoring Details

The metric evaluates context positioning through binary relevance assessment and position-based weighting.

### Scoring Process

1. Evaluates context relevance:
   - Assigns binary verdict (yes/no) to each piece
   - Records position in sequence
   - Documents relevance reasoning

2. Applies position weights:
   - Earlier positions weighted more heavily (weight = 1/(position + 1))
   - Sums weights of relevant pieces
   - Normalizes by maximum possible score

Final score: `(weighted_sum / max_possible_sum) * scale`

### Score interpretation
(0 to scale, default 0-1)
- 1.0: Optimal - most relevant context first
- 0.7-0.9: Good - relevant context mostly early
- 0.4-0.6: Mixed - relevant context scattered
- 0.1-0.3: Suboptimal - relevant context mostly later
- 0.0: Poor ordering - relevant context at end or missing

## Example with Analysis

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { ContextPositionMetric } from "@mastra/evals/llm";

// Configure the model for evaluation
const model = openai("gpt-4o-mini");

const metric = new ContextPositionMetric(model, {
  context: [
    "A balanced diet is important for health.",
    "Exercise strengthens the heart and improves blood circulation.",
    "Regular physical activity reduces stress and anxiety.",
    "Exercise equipment can be expensive.",
  ],
});

const result = await metric.measure(
  "What are the benefits of exercise?",
  "Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health and mental wellbeing.",
);

// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.5,
//   info: {
//     reason: "The score is 0.5 because while the second and third contexts are highly
//           relevant to the benefits of exercise, they are not optimally positioned at
//           the beginning of the sequence. The first and last contexts are not relevant
//           to the query, which impacts the position-weighted scoring."
//   }
// }
```
