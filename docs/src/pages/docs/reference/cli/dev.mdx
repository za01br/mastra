## Routes

Starting the server with `mastra dev` exposes a set of REST endpoints by default:

### Agent Routes

Agents are expected to be exported from `src/mastra/agents`.

• `GET /api/agents`
  - Lists the registered agents found in your Mastra folder.
• `POST /api/agents/:agentId/generate`
  - Sends a text-based prompt to the specified agent, returning the agent's response.

### Tool Routes

Tools are expected to be exported from `src/mastra/tools` (or the configured tools directory).

• `POST /api/tools/:toolName`
  - Invokes a specific tool by name, passing input data in the request body.

### Workflow Routes

Workflows are expected to be exported from `src/mastra/workflows` (or the configured workflows directory).

• `POST /api/workflows/:workflowName/start`
  - Starts the specified workflow.
• `POST /api/workflows/:workflowName/:instanceId/event`
  - Sends an event or trigger signal to an existing workflow instance.
• `GET /api/workflows/:workflowName/:instanceId/status`
  - Returns status info for a running workflow instance.

### OpenAPI Specification

• `GET /openapi.json`
  - Returns an auto-generated OpenAPI specification for your project's endpoints.

## Additional Notes

The port defaults to 4111.

Make sure you have your environment variables set up in your `.env.development` or `.env` file for any providers you use (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.).

### Example request

To test an agent after running `mastra dev`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/myAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can you assist me today?" }
    ]
  }'
```
