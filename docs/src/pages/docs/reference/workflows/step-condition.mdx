# StepCondition

Conditions determine whether a step should execute based on the output of previous steps or trigger data.

## Usage

There are three ways to specify conditions: function, query object, and simple path comparison.

### 1. Function Condition
```typescript copy showLineNumbers
workflow.step(processOrder, {
  when: async ({ context }) => {
    const auth = context?.getStepResult<{status: string}>("auth");
    return auth?.status === "authenticated";
  }
});
```

### 2. Query Object
```typescript copy showLineNumbers
workflow.step(processOrder, {
  when: {
    ref: { step: 'auth', path: 'status' },
    query: { $eq: 'authenticated' }
  }
});
```

### 3. Simple Path Comparison
```typescript copy showLineNumbers
workflow.step(processOrder, {
  when: {
    "auth.status": "authenticated"
  }
});
```

Based on the type of condition, the workflow runner will try to match the condition to one of these types.

1. Simple Path Condition (when there's a dot in the key)
2. Base/Query Condition (when there's a 'ref' property)
3. Function Condition (when it's an async function)

## StepCondition

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "ref",
      type: "{ stepId: string | 'trigger'; path: string }",
      description: "Reference to step output value. stepId can be a step ID or 'trigger' for initial data. path specifies location of value in step result",
      isOptional: false
    },
    {
      name: "query",
      type: "Query<any>",
      description: "MongoDB-style query using sift operators ($eq, $gt, etc)",
      isOptional: false
    }
  ]}
/>

## Query

The Query object provides MongoDB-style query operators for comparing values from previous steps or trigger data. It supports basic comparison operators like `$eq`, `$gt`, `$lt` as well as array operators like `$in` and `$nin`, and can be combined with and/or operators for complex conditions.

This query syntax allows for readable conditional logic for determining whether a step should execute.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "$eq",
      type: "any",
      description: "Equal to value"
    },
    {
      name: "$ne",
      type: "any",
      description: "Not equal to value"
    },
    {
      name: "$gt",
      type: "number",
      description: "Greater than value"
    },
    {
      name: "$gte",
      type: "number",
      description: "Greater than or equal to value"
    },
    {
      name: "$lt",
      type: "number",
      description: "Less than value"
    },
    {
      name: "$lte",
      type: "number",
      description: "Less than or equal to value"
    },
    {
      name: "$in",
      type: "any[]",
      description: "Value exists in array"
    },
    {
      name: "$nin",
      type: "any[]",
      description: "Value does not exist in array"
    },
    {
      name: "and",
      type: "StepCondition[]",
      description: "Array of conditions that must all be true"
    },
    {
      name: "or",
      type: "StepCondition[]",
      description: "Array of conditions where at least one must be true"
    }
  ]}
/>
