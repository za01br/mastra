# Workflow.resume()

The `.resume()` method continues execution of a suspended workflow step, optionally providing new context data that will be merged with existing step results.

## Usage

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
await workflow.resume({
  runId: "abc-123",
  stepId: "stepTwo",
  context: {
    secondValue: 100
  }
});
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "config",
      type: "object",
      description: "Configuration for resuming the workflow",
      isOptional: false
    }
  ]}
/>

### config

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "runId",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier of the workflow run to resume",
      isOptional: false
    },
    {
      name: "stepId",
      type: "string",
      description: "ID of the suspended step to resume",
      isOptional: false
    },
    {
      name: "context",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      description: "New context data to merge with existing step results",
      isOptional: true
    }
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "Promise<WorkflowResult>",
      type: "object",
      description: "Result of the resumed workflow execution"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Async/Await Flow

When a workflow is resumed, execution continues from the point immediately after the `suspend()` call in the step's execution function. This creates a natural flow in your code:

```typescript
// Step definition with suspend point
const reviewStep = new Step({
  id: "review",
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    // First part of execution
    const initialAnalysis = analyzeData(context.data);

    if (initialAnalysis.needsReview) {
      // Suspend execution here
      await suspend({ analysis: initialAnalysis });

      // This code runs after resume() is called
      // context now contains any data provided during resume
      return {
        reviewedData: enhanceWithFeedback(initialAnalysis, context.feedback)
      };
    }

    return { reviewedData: initialAnalysis };
  }
});

// Later, resume the workflow
const result = await workflow.resume({
  runId: "workflow-123",
  stepId: "review",
  context: {
    // This data will be available in the context after suspend()
    feedback: "Looks good, but improve section 3"
  }
});
```

### Execution Flow

1. The workflow runs until it hits `await suspend()` in the `review` step
2. The workflow state is persisted and execution pauses
3. Later, `workflow.resume()` is called with new context data
4. Execution continues from the point after `suspend()` in the `review` step
5. The new context data (`feedback`) is available to the step
6. The step completes and returns its result
7. The workflow continues with subsequent steps

## Error Handling

The resume function may throw several types of errors:

```typescript
try {
  await workflow.resume({
    runId,
    stepId: "stepTwo",
    context: newData
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message === "No snapshot found for workflow run") {
    // Handle missing workflow state
  }
  if (error.message === "Failed to parse workflow snapshot") {
    // Handle corrupted workflow state
  }
}
```
