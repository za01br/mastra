# DB Storage

Mastra synced records in your Postgres database, and uses Prisma as an access layer to that data.

## Access Layer

You can access the DB storage layer using the `DB` object in the framework. For more, see the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/crud#read).

Here's [an example](https://github.com/mastra-inc/future/blob/main/examples/contact-book/src/app/actions/record.ts#L12):

```ts
const record = await mastra.dataLayer.db.record.findUnique({
  where: {
    id: recordId,
  },
});
```

## DB Schema

In order to allow you to continue to control migrations on your database, while letting Mastra use it to sync data into, Mastra uses the Postgres concept of [schemas](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html).

For more details, look at `/src/prisma/schema.prisma` in the core package.

### Records

Records represent individual data entries in the system. Each record has the following fields:

| Field            | Type                     | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id               | `String   `              | Unique identifier for the record, automatically generated using CUID         |
| externalId       | `String` (optional)      | An optional external identifier for the record                               |
| data             | `Json`                   | JSON object storing the record's data, defaults to an empty object           |
| source           | `String`                 | The source of the record, defaults to "MANUAL"                               |
| entityType       | `String`                 | The type of entity associated with this record                               |
| entity           | `Entity` (optional)      | Relation to an Entity object                                                 |
| entityId         | `String` (optional)      | The ID of the related Entity                                                 |
| status           | `RecordStatus`           | The current status of the record, defaults to ACTIVE                         |
| enrichmentStatus | `RecordEnrichmentStatus` | The enrichment status of the record, defaults to UNAPPLIED                   |
| deletedAt        | `DateTime` (optional)    | Timestamp when the record was deleted (null if not deleted)                  |
| createdAt        | `DateTime`               | Timestamp when the record was created, automatically set to the current time |
| updatedAt        | `DateTime`               | Timestamp when the record was last updated, defaults to the creation time    |

{/* Note: The `RecordStatus` and `RecordEnrichmentStatus` are enum types defined elsewhere in the schema. */}

### Connections

Connections represent one user in one external system.

| Field          | Type                    | Description                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id             | `String`                | Unique identifier for the entity, automatically generated using CUID            |

| issues         | `String[]`              | An array of issues associated with the entity, defaults to an empty array       |
| syncConfig     | `Json` (optional)       | JSON object storing synchronization configuration for the entity                |
| connectionId   | `String`                | A reference identifier for the entity                                           |
| createdAt      | `DateTime`              | Timestamp when the entity was created, automatically set to the current time    |
| updatedAt      | `DateTime` (optional)   | Timestamp when the entity was last updated                                      |
| lastSyncAt     | `DateTime` (optional)   | Timestamp of the last synchronization for this entity                           |
| credential     | `Credential` (optional) | Relation to a Credential object                                                 |
